Each week that they are bonded to the Trickster, the bonded mortals increase their doomed value by 1; their doomed value cannot be increased above 3 by this ability and their doomed value cannot decrease while they remain bonded to the Trickster. The Immortal Trickster can be bonded with up to six mortals at a time, and they can take this action again to end the bond or to form a new bond. The bond also ends if the mortal dies. Whenever one of his bonded mortals dies, the Immortal Trickster becomes Drained 1 or increases the value of his drained condition by 1, and the Trickster gains a +2 status bonus on the next attack roll or skill check he attempts.</p>"

Mythic ambusher gogiteths are unnaturally silent, however. The first sound a creature might hear when being hunted by such a monstrosity is the sharp wheeze of their own fleeting breath as the gogiteth's jaws snap shut around them, or the tearing of their flesh and clothing as one of its legs pierces them through.</p>\n<p>Though little is known about the origins of gogiteths, mythic gogiteths generally acquire mythic power in the same way that other creatures do. Golarion has no shortage of vile deities who might take cruel delight in bestowing a sliver of mythic power upon a creature as frightful and terrible as a gogiteth. Their traditional hive homes in the Darklands make it unlikely that they would be affected by the Godsrain, but it is not impossible that droplets of Gorum's spilled blood could seep through cracks and make their way down into the thirsty jaws of one of these nightmarish monstrosities.</p>",

They are physically striking, with the hindquarters of a lion and the head, wings, and forelimbs of a great bird of prey—typically an eagle, but some instead bear the features of a hawk, falcon, or even an osprey or vulture. In rare cases, the griffon's hindquarters may resemble those of a different great cat, such as a leopard or tiger. The variations seem to conform to the griffon's environment—for instance, especially rare griffons of northern Avistan have the hindquarters of a Grungir lynx and the upper body of a snowy owl.</p>\n<p>Wild griffons rely on their powerful wings to hold them aloft and their keen eyesight to spy out prey. The speed with which they plunge toward the ground and snatch up victims is astonishing. They often tear apart a kill's flesh with razor-sharp beaks but not before alighting to secluded location where they can enjoy their meal without interruption. Griffons hunting to feed their chicks are more cautious, tearing apart prey rather than risking bringing a living creature back to their nests.</p>\n<p>Skilled animal trainers long ago learned how to raise griffons as mounts for military forces or powerful individuals. Such mounts are known for their strength, bravery, and unfailing loyalty. They are among the smartest of animals, and many griffon variants are considered intelligent beasts instead; it's thought that a griffon chooses its rider as much as a rider chooses the griffon. The process of training a griffon to accept and carry a rider in flight is a long and expensive ordeal. Griffon trainers charge rich sums for their services, and a ruler who can boast of owning a stable of griffons is the subject of great respect and envy.</p>",

If a group of mythic ogre bosses were to band together, they could prove a terrifying threat, conquering villages or even a small city with relative ease. Fortunately, their philosophies of violence and strength over all else means that whenever such beings come into contact, they are far more likely to immediately war with each other to prove who is the strongest.</p>",

The monster attempts an Athletics check opposed by the grabbed creature's Reflex DC. If it succeeds, it swallows the creature.

The swallowed creature takes the listed amount of damage when first swallowed and at the end of each of its turns while it's swallowed. If the victim Escapes this ability's grabbed condition, it exits through the monster's mouth. This frees any other creature grabbed in the monster's mouth or jaws. A swallowed creature can attack the monster that has swallowed it, but only with unarmed attacks or with weapons of light Bulk or less. The swallowing creature is Off-Guard against the attack. If the monster takes piercing or slashing damage equaling or exceeding the listed Rupture value from a single attack or spell, the swallowed creature cuts itself free. A creature that gets free by either Escaping or cutting itself free can immediately breathe and exits the swallowing monster's space.</p>\n<p>Effect: Engulf and Swallow Whole</p>\n<p>If the monster dies, a swallowed creature can be freed by creatures adjacent to the corpse if they spend a combined total of 3 actions cutting the monster open with a weapon or unarmed attack that deals piercing or slashing damage.</p></p>"

Each time a creature in the web begins to use a move action or enters the web during a move action it's using, it must attempt an Athletics check or Reflex save against your spell DC to avoid taking a circumstance penalty to its Speeds or becoming Immobilized. A creature that gets out of the web ceases to take a circumstance penalty to its Speed from the web. Each square can be cleared of the web by a single attack or effect that deals at least 5 slashing damage or 1 fire damage. A square has AC 5, and it automatically fails its saving throws.</p><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected, and it doesn't need to attempt further Athletics checks or saving throws against the web this turn. If it used an Athletics check, it clears the web from every square it leaves during its movement.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is unaffected during its action.
